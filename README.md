# Workflow

## Purpose

This tool can be included on each page to help direct a workflow. 
If you have passed a parameter in the URL that indicates that it is part of the workflow, it will direct you to the next step. 

The goal is that you could add this to any pages that you wanted and it would guide you through the different screens that you need to get to.
